# M3 better_portal

A Better Bunnings Portal.

The login process through R3 takes approximtly 25 seconds and 12 clicks (if using password managers) to view the roster.

This project demonstrates a concept web application I have been working on that is capable of:
1) Retrieving data from R3
2) Reducing the steps taken to login
3) Remembering latest login details
4) Allowing the option to export your shifts to your favourite calendar
5) Supporting a responsive mobile friendly view

M3 is a cross platform Flutter application that interacts with custom API to retrive user data.

The project uses a custom made Flask API running on Google Cloud Server and using Google Cloud storage to remember user session details.
